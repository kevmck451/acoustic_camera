#### Connect Pi Hardware
- Follow screen instructions for proper connection

## Raspberry Pi Setup
- [RaspPi Set Up Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html)

#### Flash SD Card
- Matrix Voice only works with Buster OS
- Link to img zip file [Link](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf.zip)
- Used Raspberry Pi imager to image the SD card with this .img file
- Settings
  - set username / password
  - turn ssh on
  - enter WIFI credentials (optional: if using screen, you can do this later)

#### Set Up
- Go through on screen instructions
- Change Interface Settings
  - Home Icon / Preferences / Raspberry Pi Configuration
    - Enable everything
- Reboot as needed

#### SSH into Pi
- Open terminal on pi (ctr + alt + t)
```zsh
# Need IP4 address
ifconfig
# Look for IP4 192.168.0.111 or inet 192.168.0.111
#If you set up a hostname, you can use it instead of the IP address

# Need root user name (should be green): pi is default
pi@raspberrypi:~ $
# Type this command with your info replaced: 
ssh pi@192.168.0.111
# if using hostname
# ssh pi@hostname.local
# ssh-keygen -f "/Users/KevMcK/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.0.147"

# Update everything
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
sudo reboot
````
## Project Directory / Github Connection
- My preferred work flow is to program and run files on the pi from my desktop computer as opposed to on the pi directly. 
- If you are doing everything on the pi, then you can skip this step. 
- It's still recommended to create a github repo to back up your work and tracking progress.
- clone repo to pi and desktop computer
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/kevmck451/acoustic_camera
```

## Camera Module
#### Links:
- [PiCamera2 Library Documentation](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf)

#### First Connection
- New versions of rpi should have camera packages preinstalled
- To test if camera is working, type this command in terminal
- This should bring up a window with camera feed for about 5 seconds
```zsh
rpicam-hello
```
- if using through ssh, then you can type this command before rpicam-hello
```zsh
export DISPLAY=:0
```


#### Install Dependecies
- Install OpenCV
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision
```zsh
sudo apt install -y python3-opencv
sudo apt install -y opencv-data
```
- Install FFmpeg
- FFmpeg is a powerful multimedia framework capable of decoding, encoding, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter, and play almost anything that humans and machines have created
- It's widely used for video and audio processing tasks, including format conversion, compression, streaming, and more
```zsh
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
```

## Example Scripts

#### Setup your Virtual Environment
```zsh
# cd into folder
cd acoustic_camera/
# create virtual env with system packages
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages camera_venv
# activate environ
source camera_venv/bin/activate
# add it to your gitignore
nano .gitignore # add camera_venv/ 
```

#### Go through example scripts
```zsh
cd acoustic_camera/TestScripts/camera/
```
1_test.py: works
- got this message 
  - ```QStandardPaths: wrong permissions on runtime directory /run/user/1000, 0770 instead of 0700```
  - this stopped it:
  - ```chmod 0700 /run/user/1000```
